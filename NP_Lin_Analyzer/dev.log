1. The initial program (v1p0) was designed to work with initial and fitted RMC
models, where it is assumed that the atomic order in both is consistent.
However, when swap is enabled, the atomic order will change in the fitted config
as compared to the initial one and therefore v1p0 won't work properly in this
case.

2. The new implementation now is working with unique labels for atoms, composed
of reference cell and reference number in RMC6F file (therefore, both of these
two pieces of information are required to be existing in the file).
