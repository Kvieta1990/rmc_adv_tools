Introduction
============

This repository is for collecting all the tools useful for either data
processing or post-analysis for the RMC configuration.

There are three types of tools included in current respository,

1. Python modules which can be installed and called conveniently - these modules
have been packaged up and made available through `conda` (details can be found
in the documentation, for which the link will be provided below).

2. Dedicated Python scripts for conducting specific RMC configurations analysis.
These scripts have all been distributed along with the RMCProfile release
package and can be accessed through RMCProfile command window. Necessary
dependencies can be installed through `conda` (details can be found
in the documentation, for which the link will be provided below).

3. Dedicated graphical user interface for either data processing and RMC
fitting. These are also made available through `conda` and again details can be
found in the documentation, for which the link will be provided below.

Installation
============

The installation for tools falling into each of the three categories mentioned
above is a bit different and will be discussed in details in the documentation
provided below.
