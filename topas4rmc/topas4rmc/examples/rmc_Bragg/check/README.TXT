This folder contains the comparison between the RMC Bragg running result (0 minute run) with the tabulated Topas profiles and the running result with Topas itself.

In Topas, the thermal paramters were set to 0 so we have a perfect structure and also as mentioned, RMC was run for 0 minute with a perfect structure. Therefore, if the implementation of the tabulated Topas profiles work perfectly in RMCProfile, the two results mentioned above should sit on top of each other.

This is exactly the case as can be seen from the figure included in current folder.

The 'RMCProfile_run.dat' contains the RMCProfile result and the 'Topas_T0_check.dat' file then contains the Topas result.
