:ref:`RMC Tools<rmc_tools>`
===========================

All RMC tools have been included in RMCProfile release package available at,
https://sourceforge.net/projects/rmcprofile/, **except** `topas4rmc` and
`sofq_calib` (for these two packages, installation instructions can be found
in their dedicated documentation page at :ref:`Topas4RMC<topas4rmc>` and
:ref:`SofQ_Calib<sofq_calib>`, respectively). Users can just download the
RMCProfile releaes package on a specific platform and no extra installation is
needed to get access those RMC analysis tools (again, `topas4rmc` and
`sofq_calib` not in the list here - they do need extra bit of installation).
